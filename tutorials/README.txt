/g/sicp readme for tuts

This is a document to docuwriters for instructions on writing them and
making requests for tutorial comments.

Just keep it simple and try to put yourself in the readers position when writing.
If general layout questions or such, just ask in the chan for help/ideas.


Document layout & syntax:

Use plain html to format the tuts/docs, easy to convert and easy to write.
Vote for LaTex:

<h1> For document title
<h2> For Major section title ie. 2
<h3> For Subsection title ie. 2.1
<h4> For highlighting in subsection or for sub sub section title ie. 2.2.1
<p> for all text, remember to paragraph enough
<pre> for code blocks
<ul><li> for lists, nested if needed
<hr> between every major and sub section

Using anchors and anchor names is encouraged in table of contents and section titles,
for easy navigation. Ie. in contents <li><a href="#1.3">nnnanan</a></li> and in body
<h3><a name="1.3">nnnanan</a></h3>

See C++ tut for example.

You can use something like http://htmledit.squarefree.com/ to do live formatting,
